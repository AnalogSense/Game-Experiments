## Automatic profile switcher for Wooting keyboards

Automatically switches the profile on your Wooting keyboard based on if a game is focused and what state the game is in.

### Profile Setup

This program is made to "just work" with the factory state of Wooting keyboards:

1. "Digital Profile" - No game active.
2. "Rapid Profile" - Unused by this program.
3. "Racing Profile" - Used for "in vehicle" contexts: W and S are mapped to RT and LT. A and D are mapped to LSTICK LEFT and LSTICK RIGHT. "Gamepad mapping override" is enabled.
4. "Mixed Movement" - Used for most game contexts: WASD is mapped to LSTICK directional inputs. "Gamepad mapping override" is enabled.

However, note that the default state of Wooting keyboards has "Gamepad Mode" set to "No Gamepad", so do be sure to change this so it can be recognised as a controller.
